# Lattice

A Simple (for now) Discord chat bridge for Hytale.

## Setup

### 1. Install The Mod

Put the jar file into the `mods` folder.

Then run the server with mod installed to generate the config file, it will propbaly complain that the discord token is invalid, don't panic it's normal we will set it in the now generated config under `mods/me.theclashfruit_Lattice/Lattice.json`.

The config file should look something like this:

```json
{
  "Token": "your_token_here",
  "ChannelId": "",
  "WebhookId": "",
  "ChatPrefix": "[Discord]",
  "ChatPrefixColour": "#5865F2"
}
```

### 2. Create a Discord Bot

Create your bot on the discord developer portal and also enable `Message Content Intent` for your bot then paste the token into the config where it says `your_token_here`.

### 3. Create a Channel & Webhook

Create your channel and copy its id into the channel id in the config. Then go into the settings for the channel and create a webhook and copy it's url, which should look something like `https://discord.com/api/webhooks/1460971511903948851/ydte1zUhNKBVzvpUlsAyGDrdAb83HvYRIl_KiDYhgKJ1x4kgMNCfMfAl3TGklrsegGmo`[^1], copy it's numerical part, here it's `1460971511903948851` and paste it into the config for the `WebhookId`.

### 4. Restart The Server

Restart the server and chat with people on Discord :3

(I suck at writing docs)

[^1]: No that webhook is deleted and I also mangled the token a bit :3
